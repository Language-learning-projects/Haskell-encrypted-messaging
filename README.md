# Haskell encrypted messaging

This repository contains code of a learning project called: "Haskell encrypted messaging".

It's purpose is to build a command-line program to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Idea

A command-line program that uses cryptography algorithms to encrypt and decrypt messages. The program should use a linked list data structure to store the characters of the message and a queue to implement a Caesar cipher algorithm. The program should also use a tree data structure to store the frequency of the characters and a Huffman coding algorithm to compress and decompress the message.

## Learning

- Haskell
- Linked List
- Queue
- Tree
- Caesar cipher algorithm
- Huffman coding algorithm

## Requirements

- A user should be able to encrypt a message using a simple command together with the text to encrypt.
- A user should be able to decrypt a message using a simple command together with the text to decrypt.
